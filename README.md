# swarm_intelligence_simulator
This Swarm Intelligence Simulator is an interactive environment that models the behavior of agents exhibiting swarm-like dynamics. It allows you to visualize the behavior of various agents ("swarm members") who interact with each other and their environment to achieve specific roles, such as leading, exploring, or following.
